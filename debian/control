Description: "No Tofu" font families with large Unicode coverage
 Noto is a collection of font families, each visually harmonized across
 scripts.  This package contains the Noto font families with hinting:
 .
 ${fonts:familylist}
 .
 The name "Noto" is short for "No Tofu", describing the aim of covering
 all living Unicode scripts
 (currently ${fonts:scriptcount} are covered, at least partly).
 .
 Tofu (豆腐) is japanese jargon for the white box character "�" often
 displayed as replacement for an unassigned or unknown character.
